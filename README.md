Tamagotchi

The program functions are a tamagotchi simulator.

Tamagotchi will starve and require attention in real-time and must be satisfied otherwise they will perish.

Once ran, the program will give the user options to check, feed, or play with the tamagotchi. Game can end whenever the user asks to quit
or when the tamagotchi dies and the user does not decide to hatch a new one.
